## Rush02

### MVP

Create a program that takes a number as argument and converts it to its written letters value.

Turn-in directory: `ex00/`

Files to turn in: `Makefile and all the necessary files`

Allowed functions : `write`, `malloc`, `free`, `open`, `read`, `close`


---

- Executable name: `rush-02`
- Your source code will be compiled as follows :
```
make fclean
make
```
- Your program can take up to 2 arguments:
	- If there is only one argument, it is the value you need to convert
	- If there are two arguments, the first argument is the new reference dictionary and the second argument is the value you need to convert.
- If the argument isn’t a valid positive integer, your program must return "Error", followed by a newline.
- Your program must parse the dictionary given as resource to the project. The values inside it must be used to print the result. These values can be modified.
- Any memory allocated on the heap (with malloc(3)) must be freed correctly. This will be verified during evaluation.
- The dictionary will have the following rules:

`[a number][0 to n spaces]:[0 to n spaces][any printable characters]\n`
- You will trim the spaces before and after the value in the dictionary.
- The dictionary will always have at least the keys as in the reference dictionary.
	- Their value can be modified, more entries can be added, but the initial keys can’t be removed.
- You only need to use the initial entries (For instance, if we add 54: fifty-four, you still have to use 50: fifty and 4: four)
	- The entries of the dictionary can be stored in any order.
	- There can be empty lines in the dictionary.
	- If you have any errors from the dictionary parsing, your program must output `Dict Error\n`
	- If the dictionary doesn’t allow you to resolve the asked value, your programmust output `Dict Error\n`.
- Example:
```
$> ./rush-02 42 | cat -e
forty two$
$> ./rush-02 0 | cat -e
zero$
$> ./rush-02 10.4 | cat -e
error$
$> ./rush-02 100000 | cat -e
one hundred thousand$
$> grep "20" numbers.dict | cat -e
20 : hey everybody !$
$> ./rush-02 20 | cat -e
hey everybody !$
```
### Bonus
- Use customized key-value data: 54: fifty-four instead of 50: fifty and 4:
four
- Using -, ,, and to be closer to the correct written syntax
- Doing the same exercice in a different language. For this, you are allowed to provide
another dictionary which will contain the necessary entries.
- Using read to read standard entry when there is no argument
- Any other bonus that you think bring something more to the project
